# Roulette
My very first official (and ugly) programming project.

Back in the 2010, I was attending the programming class in my first year in the University of Molise. It was a very basic class, teaching the foundations of the software programming and of the C language. At the end of the year the professor asked us to work on a project in C to present as part of the exam.

My skills were pretty basic and all I could design was standard CLI programs but I still wanted to work on something fun, with colors, interactions and animations.

So I proposed to my professor a replica of the classic Roulette french game.

I was pretty delighted by the discover that the console cells and text could have a color through Windows' APIs and I had fun building the splash screen and Roulette table in "ASCII art".

The exam went well, my professor was very impressed by the result and gave me full marks! 


I'm uploading it here 9 years later because I feel this little ugly project helped me to understand that software programming was my passion and my direction in life. Beware, the code is ugly. I just wanted to share the story of this project and to keep it in my GitHub account!

Thanks for reading. You can download the .exe file in the releases section
